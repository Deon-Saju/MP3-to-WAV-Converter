# MP3-to-WAV-Converter

#### Install Pydub 
`pip install pydub`

- Locate the folder from which you have to select the mp3 files.
- Using export() function, mention the type to which the file has to be formatted. Here I wanted to convert the .mp3 files to .wav format so I used format = "wav" for the conversion. Also mention the location to which the converted file has to be saved.
